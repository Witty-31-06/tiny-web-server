# tiny-web-server
This is a tiny basic web server built entirely in C. 
Functionalities:
Nothing much, it just displays a site, accepts two numbers in the input field and sends back the summation of those two numbers. The Backend is made in C.

This project is made with intent to explore:
Network Programming fundamentals in Linux and C
Learn about basic network system calls in Linux
Planning to explore multithreading in near future.
